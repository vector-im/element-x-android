## Module ui-strings

This module contains strings from Element Android.

The content of this module will be keep synced by the script `rootDir/tools/strings/importStringsFromElement.sh`, which is run daily by a GitHub action.

### Adding new strings

Add new strings to the file `./src/main/res/values/new_strings.xml`, or your new strings will be erased on the next sync.

Also, new strings must be added to Element Android to give a chance to get translation.

### Long term

In the future, Weblate will be synced directly with this project.
